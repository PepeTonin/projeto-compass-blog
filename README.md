# Frist Challenge

n this document, I will describe the project and showcase all the features that I have added
The blog is fully responsive. It can be viewed in both mobile and desktop versions with complete accessibility.

First, I will show the mobile version.
## Mobile

### Front page
- Top of the front page

- Top of the front page with the menu open
![opened menu](./assets/README/front-page-mobile-open-menu.jpg)
This menu is a responsive feature. When the screen is large enough, the menu button disappears, and the options stay fixed in the navbar.

- Body of the front page

In the images, you can see the pagination in action. Pagination is a feature that I added so users can navigate between the available pages more effectively.
Furthermore, I've added an advertisement to be displayed differently on larger screens.

- Footer of the front page

- Comments section

The comment section is filled with dummy data, fetched using the API [dummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/).
In addition, I've included input fields that allow users to add their own comments. When the user selects the "SEND" button or presses "Enter" while the input text box is selected, the comment is added to the section.
The image below shows the section as it was before, with a new comment added.
